  <div class="head-block"><h1>USD for Maya v0.29.0 Release Notes</h1></div><h2 id="release-highlights">Release Highlights</h2><p><strong>Support for blend shape import</strong><br>With USD for Maya 0.29, you can now import USD blend shapes into Maya blend shapes, while preserving all the attributes.   </p>

<p><strong>Upgraded transform manipulator with edit routing support</strong><br>We have upgraded our system to include edit routing support for the transform manipulator. With this enhancement, you can configure the edit router to automatically write all the transformations into a specified layer whenever the transform manipulator is utilized.  </p>
<p><strong>Ability to copy and paste a prim</strong><br>You can now copy and paste a prim in the outliner. The pasted prim will be a sibling of the original prim by default and will be selected upon creation. You also have the option to paste it as a child to another prim.  </p>
<p><strong>Improvements on export</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>We have added the capability to exclude empty transforms when exporting USD.</li>
<li>We have added the ability to export materials to USD without the geometry.</li>
<li>When exporting geometry with materials, you now have the option to export only the assigned materials.</li>
<li>We have improved the consistency of the USD prim hierarchy by standardizing how material scope is written.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Display of material attributes in the Attribute Editor</strong><br>We have enhanced the attribute editor to include the display of a prim's assigned or inherited material information. You can also open the material in the LookdevX graph editor by simply clicking on the LookdevX icon located next to the assigned material field.</p>
