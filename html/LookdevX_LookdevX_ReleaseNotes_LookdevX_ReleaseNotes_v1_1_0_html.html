  <div class="head-block"><h1>LookdevX for Maya v1.1.0 Release Notes</h1></div><p>LookdevX is a Technology Preview, meaning it's currently under active development. </p>
<br>

<h2 id="what-39-s-new">What's New</h2><ul>
<li><p>Backdrop support has been added to the Graph Editor. You can use backdrops to help visually organize complex node graphs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multiple graphs in a scene are displayed in separate tabs. Click on a tab to display it in the main editing area.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Auto-expand for attributes has been enabled. Hold “Ctrl” while hovering over an attribute to expand its sub-attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="known-limitations">Known Limitations</h2><p>There are a few known limitations. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>LOOKDEVX-1344 | (On MacOS and Linux only) LookdevX may crash when selecting a prim in the outliner and attempting to "Graph Material from Selected" from the LookdevX editor edit menu. </p>
</li>
<li><p>TABS LOOKDEVX-1276 | Closing the LookdevX window does not preserve tab states. </p>
</li>
<li><p>BACKDROPS LOOKDEVX-1215 | (On Mac only) Crash when adding a backdrop to Input/output node and clicking "L" to layout. </p>
</li>
<li><p>BACKDROPS BIFROST-1922 | Using "L" auto-layout will move a node away from a backdrop. </p>
</li>
<li><p>BACKDROPS LOOKDEVX-1153 | Right-click options to change the size and color of backdrops do not work. </p>
</li>
<li><p>BACKDROPS LOOKDEVX-1316 | Undo/Redo will not work to move a backdrop to it's previous state. </p>
</li>
<li><p>BACKDROPS LOOKDEVX-1315 | (On MacOS only). LookdevX may crash when adding a backdrop to an Input/output node and clicking "L" to layout. </p>
</li>
<li><p>During initial sessions, material libraries can be slow to load in the right-click menu of the Outliner and the tab menu of the LookdevX Graph Editor. This is caused by the MtoA plugin loading its materials libraries into Maya. Once loaded, the material libraries will populate at regular speeds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>LOOKDEVX-844 | MaterialX’s Ambient Occlusion is not supported yet. </p>
</li>
<li><p>LOOKDEVX-840 | The following MaterialX nodes can be slow to change values in the LookdevX Graph Editor: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Changing the reference space of "position", "normal", "tangent", and "bitangent" nodes. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Changing the index of a "texcoord" or "geomcolor" node. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Changing the primvar in any of the "geompropvalue" nodes. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Changing any parameter in a "swizzle" or "convert" node. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Changing the value of any "constant" node.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Instead of a constant node you can use a dot node to increase the speed of the value change. </p>
</li>
<li><p>LOOKDEVX-856 | Stronger opinions can be created if moving or deleting a node with the incorrect target layer. This can cause a state where you won’t be able to create new nodes. You can revert the layer to bypass that.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>There are some cases where materials appear differently in viewport than in render. Such as with:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Reflections of other scene elements. They will be missing since the rasterizer cannot see them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>LOOKDEVX-898 | Arnold's OSL doesn't currently have an output.  </p>
</li>
<li><p>LOOKDEVX-899 | Single channel images can appear red in the Viewport. However, they should be rendered correctly.</p>
</li>
<li><p>LOOKDEVX-1105 | Nodes do not currently support sub-component connections. However, they will still appear as available connections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
